#### Purpose

When it comes to learning data analysis methods, there is nothing like doing it yourself. By going through the process of finding appropriate data, importing and "tidying" your data, applying various analytical tools to the data, and writing up the results, you will likely learn more than from all the books and lectures combined. This process requires time, some creativity, and persistence in the face of difficulties.

#### Delivarables

On December 21, each group will deliver:

- an in-class presentation of their data, method, results and interpretation, using RPres (10-15 minutes per group, each group member should speak).
- a Github repository containing all the documents necessary to reproduce the final report (including the final report itself in PDF format). The history of the repo should show sustained collaboration by all group members over the course of the semester.

#### Guidelines

- In the first three weeks of class you should form groups of two or three students with similar fields of research or interest.
- By the middle of the semester you should have identified a suitable existing data set, and you should have discussed your choice with me in office hours/during class.
- Once we cover the use of version control in class, your group should use it to collaborate and write up your analysis.
- Your report should include a discussion of the data set (refer to the documentation), descriptive statistics and/or plots of the relevant variables, a brief presentation of the analytical method employed, the fitted model (both as numbers/coefficient estimates, and as graphs) and an interpretation of the results. 

#### To be covered in class

- Finding interesting data sources online. Reading data into RStudio.
- Using Github for version control and collaboration.
- Various data analysis tools that you can use to analyze your data (from simple multivariate regression to multilevel logistic regression)
- Principles of reproducible workflow: Documenting your work and explain what you are doing (commenting); Everything as a text; ...
- Typesetting from within RStudio: RMardown, a simple human-readable markup language that can be turned into nice PDFs, presentations, websites, ...
- Some common data problems: missing data; complex survey design; ...
