Course description
------------------

Quantitative methods are indispensable for making good decisions. All fields studied at Milano rely on statistical methods to further the corpus of knowledge and challenge received wisdom. With this in mind, this course focuses on both the theory and, in particular, the application of various modern statistical tools. The purpose is to enable students to develop a critical understanding of basic statistical concepts and techniques; proficiency in applying statistics to various social science, management, and public policy questions; and familiarity with computer software for statistical analysis, graphical presentation of data, and report writing.

The emphasis will be on applications, with the frequent use of examples. Hands-on practice with modern computing tools is integrated into the class from the start. We will discuss how to select the appropriate tools, prepare the data for analysis and interpret and present the results. Throughout the course, we learn how to make our research reproducible by following a structured workflow, writing simple code and tracking our progress with version control software. We will also learn how to use these tools to collaborate on a research project in groups.

The class builds on the linear regression model that you may have already encountered, and extends it to the multivariate case. We focus on issues of interpretation, model criticism and data transformation. In the process, we will discuss basic issues of statistical inference and introduce the distinction between observational and experimental studies, which is central to conducting policy evaluations. We then look at generalizations of the linear model, including (multinomial) logistic regression. We will spend the rest of the semester on more advanced topics, such as classification and data summarizing techniques or multilevel modeling.

*Prerequisites*: Typically students will have a background equivalent to NURP 5013 - Quantitative Methods, although we will review basic concepts in this class as well. Students in this class tend to have very different levels of preparation. I am aware of this fact, and ask you to be patient if you are seeing material that you have studied before.

Certain readings will be posted on Canvas (please check this syllabus and your email for announcements.)


### Software and Computing ###

Computers have transformed how statistical analysis is conducted in everyday work. In this class, we will learn how to use the computer for collaborating in groups, managing and analysing data, and writing reports. All of this will be done using the following very widely used, free and open-source software. Mastering these tools, even only their very basics, will give you a huge advantage in both industry and academia.

- *R*, a system for statistical analyses and graphics. *R* is available as a free download from [http://www.r-project.org](http://www.r-project.org).
- You also need to install a front-end called *RStudio*, an integrated development
environment for *R*, available free of charge from [http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).
- The version control software *Git* combines functions of backup, version control and collaboration on code and documents. You will need to open a free account on [http://www.github.com](http://www.github.com) and download the Github application.

If you plan on using your own computer during the semester, try installing these software packages before the first class. This way, I can help you if you run into difficulties during the installation.

### University resources ###

The following university resources may help you achieve academic success in this class:

- Labs and work spaces operated by the office of Academic Technology (AT). For locations of facilities and hours of operation, visit [www.newschool.edu/at](www.newschool.edu/at). All open computer labs should have  *R* and *RStudio* installed and ready to use.
- The University Help Desk is the point of contact for students, faculty, and staff requiring assistance or information on all university computing issues. Email: [helpdesk@newschool.edu](helpdesk@newschool.edu)
- The University Learning Center ([http://www.newschool.edu/learning-center](http://www.newschool.edu/learning-center)), which offers math tutoring (including statistics)
- The University (and associated) Libraries: ([http://library.newschool.edu](http://library.newschool.edu))

Learning Goals
--------------

By the end of this course, I hope that you will have made progress towards learning

- How typical research questions in science, policy and management are approached through statistical analysis, including the assumptions and limitations of different tools.
- How fundamental concepts of statistical and probability theory help you understand new tools and methods that you may need to learn later on in your own work.
- Communication and rhetorical skills: How to present results from a statistical analysis in the form of a clear, convincing and accurate report.
- Understand the importance of reproducibility and a structured workflow in group projects. Learn how to use computer software for this purpose (R scripts, version control).
- Qualitative & quantitative reasoning: How to think abstractly about complex processes and develop models that capture this complexity at the appropriate level of abstraction.

Assessments and grades
----------------------

The grade for the class is based on the following elements. Assignments should be submitted in electronic format through Canvas. Double check that your assignment was submitted: If Canvas doesn't say so, I won't have your assignment.

#### Homework ####

There should be around three homework assignments during the course. Assignments will combine tasks of setting up analyses logically with carrying them through empirically. Please formulate your own answers.

#### Mid-term exam ####

This exam will take place around two thirds of the way into the course and will cover the material seen so far during the semester. The exam will be in-class, closed book, and will emphasize conceptual understanding and interpretation of computer output. 

#### Project ####

During the course of the semester, you will be working on a research project using real-world data in small groups. Collaboration through the version control software Github will be essential to succeeding in your research project and will allow me to judge the individual contribution of each member of the group. You are encouraged to select a topic related to your field of research or interest. The first step will consist in finding a suitable existing dataset (you may need to adjust your research question to the available data). Discuss this choice with me in office hours. Then you will explore the dataset along the lines discussed in class, making sure that you understand the structure of the dataset as well as potential difficulties (we will discuss some of these in class). Finally you will conduct a statistical analysis, and write up the results in a clear and concise report of around 10-15 pages. In the last class, groups will present their work in brief presentations of no more than 15 minutes.

Detailed guidelines for the research project can be found in the file [project_assignment.md](project_assignment.md).
